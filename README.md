# 📊 Advanced Excel Practice & Projects Repository

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the **[Repository Name]** repository!

This collection is dedicated to demonstrating my journey and proficiency in **Advanced Microsoft Excel**. It serves two main purposes:

1.  **Practice:** To house various Excel files used for practicing specific formulas, functions, and data manipulation techniques.
2.  **Projects:** To showcase completed, real-world-inspired Excel projects that highlight advanced skills in data analysis, reporting, and visualization.

## 🚀 Repository Structure

The repository is structured into two main directories to clearly separate the learning material from the polished deliverables:

### 1. `practice-files/`
This folder contains individual workbooks (`.xlsx` files) and associated test files (if applicable, e.g., for unit testing data extraction). These files are focused on mastering specific advanced Excel concepts.

* **Examples of content:**
    * Dynamic array formulas (e.g., `UNIQUE`, `FILTER`, `SORT`).
    * Workbooks demonstrating complex nested formulas (e.g., advanced `SUMIFS` usage).
    * Practice files for **Power Query** (Get & Transform Data) for efficient data cleaning.
    * Files for VBA/Macros function and sub routine practice.

### 2. `completed-projects/`
This folder contains the **final, polished Excel projects** that demonstrate the application of multiple advanced techniques in a complete, solution-oriented context. Each project folder typically includes the final `.xlsx` file and a brief description file.

* **Key Projects:**
    * **[Project 1 Name/Topic]**: A comprehensive, interactive dashboard built using PivotTables, Slicers, and advanced charting.
    * **[Project 2 Name/Topic]**: A financial model or reporting tool utilizing what-if analysis and complex lookup functions.
    * **[Project 3 Name/Topic]**: A large dataset processing example using advanced Power Query M language for robust ETL.

## 💻 How to View the Files

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Required Software:** All files are compatible with **Microsoft Excel [Specify Version, e.g., 2019/365]**. Note that dynamic array formulas require a newer version of Excel (e.g., Microsoft 365 or Excel 2021).
3.  **Explore:** Start by examining the `completed-projects/` to see the final output, and then dive into `practice-files/` to see the underlying techniques.
